# Documentation Rules

All project documentation must be written in English and follow these standards.

## Language

- **All documentation must be in English**
- Use clear, concise, and professional language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary, and provide definitions when used

## File Naming

- Use UPPERCASE with underscores: `FEATURE_NAME.md`
- Be descriptive and specific
- Examples: `AUTHENTICATION.md`, `ERROR_HANDLING.md`, `USER_ROLES_ENDPOINT.md`

## Structure

Every documentation file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Title (Clear and Descriptive)

Brief introduction explaining what this document covers.

## Overview

High-level description of the feature/system.

## Features / Components

Detailed breakdown of features or components.

## Usage / Implementation

How to use or implement the feature.

## Examples

Code examples and practical use cases.

## Configuration

Configuration options and settings.

## API Reference (if applicable)

Endpoint documentation with request/response examples.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions.

## Related Documentation

Links to related documents.
```

## Formatting Standards

- Use proper markdown syntax
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Use emojis sparingly and consistently (only in main README)
- Add table of contents for long documents (>100 lines)
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)

## Code Examples

- Always include language tags in code blocks: ` ```csharp `, ` ```bash `, etc.
- Show complete, working examples when possible
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Use proper indentation and formatting

## Links and References

- Use relative paths for internal documentation links
- Reference specific files with proper paths: `docs/FEATURE.md`
- Link to code files when relevant: `src/Project/File.cs`
- **All documentation files referenced in README.md MUST be located in the `docs/` folder**
- Never place documentation files in the project root or other directories
- If a documentation file exists outside `docs/`, it must be moved to `docs/` and references updated

## Keeping Documentation Updated

- Update documentation when code changes
- Remove outdated information
- Add migration guides when breaking changes occur
- Mark deprecated features clearly

## Categories

Organize documentation by category:

- **Core Features**: Authentication, Permissions, Roles
- **Infrastructure**: Database, Configuration, Error Handling
- **API Reference**: Endpoints, DTOs, Request/Response examples
- **Guides**: Setup, Deployment, Development
- **Migration**: Breaking changes, version updates

## Examples

### Good Documentation Title

```markdown
# Authentication System

This document describes the JWT-based authentication system...
```

### Good Code Example

```csharp
// Example: Creating a new user
var user = new User
{
    Email = "user@example.com",
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "Doe"
};
```

### Good Structure

```markdown
# Feature Name

Introduction paragraph.

## Overview

Description...

## Implementation

Details...

## Examples
